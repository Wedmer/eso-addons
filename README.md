## Building from source

## Running

### AppImage with AppImageLauncher

If the app was installed through AppImageLauncher, it should have automatically created a desktop entry. This can be added to steam as a non-steam game in desktop mode where it can then be launched in game mode. The app can be closed in game mode using the steam app menu.

## Updating

TODO: cargo

### AppImage

AppImageLauncher has the option to automatically install updates, this app has been designed to take advantage of that using GitHub release information.

## Legacy

This project was originally based on the work by Trojan295 at [Trojan295/eso-addons](https://github.com/Trojan295/eso-addons). It has since devolved into the abyss, but without his work I probably would not have even started on this silliness.
